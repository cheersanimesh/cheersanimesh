# Hi there, I'm Animesh Mishra! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in AI at New York University (NYU) Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. With a strong background in deep learning, computer vision, and big data, I have a passion for developing scalable and efficient machine learning models and systems.


## üí° Projects

- **[CEMDL](https://github.com/cheersanimesh/CEMDL)**: Developed advanced CUDA kernels for auto-differentiation, GEMM operations, and deep learning architectures like ResNet-18, attention modules, and Transformers, enhancing performance and scalability.
- **CiNEDL**: Collaborated with the Indian Space Research Organisation to develop a cyclone intensity prediction model using TensorFlow and OpenCV, deployed with a ReactJS frontend and Django backend for user-friendly accessibility.
- **[Vartalaap](https://github.com/cheersanimesh/Vartalaap)**: Developed a communication application utilizing ReactJS, Redux, RabbitMQ, Node.js, Socket.IO, MongoDB, and WebRTC, incorporating OAuth-based user authentication, multiple-peer video conferencing, and chat functionalities.
- **VirDoc**: A mobile application developed in React Native for healthcare, integrating Bayesian Estimation for disease prediction, Agora SDK for real-time video consultations, and AWS EC2 for backend deployment.
